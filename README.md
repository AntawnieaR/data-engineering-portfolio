# Data Engineering Portfolio

This repository contains simple examples of data engineering work, including:

- **Python ETL pipeline** (`etl_pipeline.py`)  
  - Extracts data from a CSV file  
  - Cleans and transforms the data  
  - Loads the results into a SQLite database table  

- **SQL queries** (`sample_queries.sql`)  
  - Joins between fact and dimension tables  
  - CTE-based aggregations (monthly revenue)  
  - Data quality checks and duplicate detection  

These examples are designed to demonstrate core skills in:
ETL development, SQL, Python, data quality, and pipeline design used in data engineering and data operations roles.
